<h3> Information design in matching problems: Evidence from an online experiment </h3> 

With [Lenka Fiala](https://www.lenkafiala.com) and [Sulagna Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/view/sulagna/home?authuser=0).

<b>Abstract:</b>
In one-sided matching settings such as school choice and task allocation, objects are allocated to agents based on agent preferences. However, agents may not always know, a priori, their preferences over the objects, because they do not have enough information. In this context, we experimentally investigate the question: How should a benevolent planner optimally reveal information to the agents to maximize welfare? To this end, we conduct an online experiment to test the theoretical predictions of [Dasgupta (2020)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yedWFi3ijiKn9zaFUU8BQPFjy-iwAc2l/view) who proposes recommendations, and identify behavioral explanations in case of a possible mismatch between model and behavior in the experiment.
