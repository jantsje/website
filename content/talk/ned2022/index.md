abstract: Presentation in Academic Session B-8 on behavioral economics. I will present preliminary results of our online experiment using a new two-person sender-receiver game in which the Receiver decides between a default option with zero payoffs for self and charity, versus a button click which yields a positive payoff to self, but uncertain payoffs for charity. This paper examines under which circumstances people are willing to interfere by sharing or hiding information; in other words, the supply of willful ignorance. We use a simple online experiment to explore three possible concerns in this situation; own payoffs, charity payoffs and concerns about the decision maker.
