abstract: Climate change increases the risk of severe floods and hurricanes. I use economic experiments to examine and improve disaster preparedness through risk communication, for example by showing a flooded home in Virtual Reality. Carefully testing how people respond to different warning scales and messages can prevent considerable damage and  will ultimately save lives.
