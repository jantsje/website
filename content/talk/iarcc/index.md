abstract: Many individuals experience problems understanding and preparing for low-probability high-impact risk, like natural disasters and pandemics â€“ unless they experience these events, yet then it is often too late to avoid damages. Individuals with recent disaster risk experience are, on average, better prepared. In this study, Dr Jantsje Mol used immersive virtual reality (VR) technology to examine whether a simulated disaster can stimulate people to invest in risk-reducing measures in the context of flooding, which is one of the deadliest and most damaging natural disasters in the world. Dr Jantsje Mol and her team investigated the possibility of boosting risk perception, coping appraisal, negative emotions and damage-reducing behavior through a simulated flooding experience. Join us for a very (virtual) interactive webinar session!
