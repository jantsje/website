abstract: During a hurricane, it is vital that individuals receive communications that are easy to process and provide sufficient information to allow informed hurricane evacuation decisions and prevent loss of life. Without satisfactory and complete information, an individual is likely to miscalculate their personal risk or even potentially be moved to inaction. However, much recent research has shown an over-reliance on the currently-utilized Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS) despite the fact that it only captures one aspect of a hurricane, the wind threat. We study how the hurricane presentation format (traditional NOAA Saffir Simpson scale versus newly developed TCSS scale with or without graphic) impacts intent to evacuate and understanding of hurricane severity. We use a between-subject 2x2 design where participants are assigned to either the Saffir Simpson scale or the TCSS scale and further assigned to only the scale or the scale with a graphic. We collect data in a large-scale (N = 4,000) online experiment to examine potential differences in comprehension, risk perception and anticipated evacuation decisions among relevant decision makers (citizens in U.S. coastal states under hurricane threat). Policy implications for risk communication and emergency planning are discussed.
