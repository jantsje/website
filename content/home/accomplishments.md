The topics covered include dynamic cost-benefit analysis (i.e., the valuation of climate damages, discounting future mitigation benefits, mitigation costs as investment decisions), integrated assessment models used to determine optimal emission abatement and the social cost of carbon, the choice of policy instruments (e.g., carbon taxes, polluting permits, standards) considering their effectiveness, their distributive effects, and their public support, as well as other topics such as international climate agreements, the link between international trade and climate change, the risk of stranded assets, and the prospects of a green technological revolution."""
