I am a postdoctoral researcher at [CREED](https://www.creedexperiment.nl/creed/), the Center for Research in Experimental Economics and political Decision making of the University of Amsterdam. My main interests are experimental economics and behavioral economics. 

I have a research master in Neuroeconomics from Maastricht University, with a particular focus on experimental economics, behavioral economics and virtual reality. My PhD supervisors are [Wouter Botzen](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/wjw-botzen) and [Julia Blasch](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/julia-blasch). My PhD project aimed to improve individual flood-preparedness by finding the determinants of individual decisions to invest in flood damage mitigation measures. 
*I will defend my dissertation September 10, 2021.*

Currently, I am working in the team of [Shaul Shalvi](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/s/h/s.shalvi/s.shalvi.html) on a [project](https://behavioralethics.org/project/trustpath/) studying the importance of trust in the sharing economy.
