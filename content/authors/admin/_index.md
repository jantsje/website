I am a postdoctoral researcher at [CREED](https://www.creedexperiment.nl/creed/), the Center for Research in Experimental Economics and political Decision making of the University of Amsterdam and a Research Fellow at [Tinbergen](https://www.tinbergen.nl). My main interests are experimental economics and behavioral economics. 

I have a research master in neuroeconomics from Maastricht University and a PhD in behavioral economics from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My PhD thesis entitled **Improving flood preparedness using insights from economic experiments** can be found [here](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/improving-flood-preparedness-using-insights-from-economic-experim). 

Currently, I am working on a [project](https://behavioralethics.org/project/trustpath/) studying the importance of trust in the sharing economy.
