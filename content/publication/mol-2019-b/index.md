abstract: "In a world in which economic losses due to natural disasters are expected to increase,
it is important to study risk reduction strategies, including individual investments
of homeowners in damage reducing (mitigation) measures. We use a lab experiment
(N = 357) to investigate the effects of different financial incentives, probability levels
and deductibles on damage reducing investments in a natural disaster insurance market
with compulsory coverage. In particular, we examine how these investments are jointly
influenced by financial incentives, like a disincentive from moral hazard or positive
incentives from premium discounts or a mitigation loan, and behavioral characteristics,
like individual risk and time preferences. We find that investments increase when
the expected value of damage increases (i.e. higher deductibles, higher probabilities).
Moral hazard is found in the high probability scenarios (15%), but not in the low
probability scenarios (3%). This observation suggests that moral hazard is less of an
issue in a natural disaster insurance market where probabilities are low. Our results
demonstrate that a premium discount can increase investments in damage reduction,
as can the behavioral characteristics of risk aversion, perceived efficacy of protective
measures and worry about flooding.
