The more precise and up-to-date information people have on the (expected) impact of a disaster on themselves, the better their ability to respond in a timely and effective way. The more stressful a situation is perceived to be, the more urgently people will seek to clarify it in order to alleviate their own anxiety. In such situations, rumors can compensate for information and knowledge gaps. Uncertainty in a threatening situation paired with information scarcity can be a breeding ground for misinformation. We are exploring people’s susceptibility to misinformation during a disaster (“hot phase”) to learn about factors that can increase resilience and can be addressed in the “cold phase”. We are developing an experimental study using a virtual reality environment to simulate a disaster event with participants in 2-3 countries. The study will provide insights into the extent to which people are susceptible to misinformation during disaster events of varying severity. The results will inform disaster preparedness initiatives.\nLink to the European Commission Behavioural Insights project page here.\n[in development]\n","date":1729036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1729036800,"objectID":"33617f046a41823e2fc19f7f4d436170","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/project/susceptibility-misinfo/","publishdate":"2024-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/susceptibility-misinfo/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring people’s susceptibility to misinformation during a disaster.

This study offers such insights using innovative real-time (N = 871) and repeated (N = 255) surveys of a sample of coastal residents in Florida regarding flood preparations and their drivers during an imminent threat posed by Hurricane Dorian and its aftermath. Compared with commonly employed cross-sectional surveys, our methodology better represents relationships between preparedness actions undertaken during the disaster threat and their drivers derived from an extended version of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The repeated survey allows for examining temporal dynamics in these drivers. Our results confirm the importance of coping appraisals and show that risk perceptions relate more strongly to emergency protection decisions made during the period of the disaster threat than to decisions made well before. Moreover, we find that several personal characteristics that we add to the standard PMT framework significantly relate to undertaking preparedness actions, especially locus of control and social norms. Significant changes in key explanatory variables occur following the disaster threat, including a decline in risk perception, a potential learning effect in coping appraisals, and a decline in risk aversion. Our results confirm the advantage of the real-time and repeated survey approach in understanding both short- and long-term disaster preparedness actions.

Enhanced flood preparedness among the coastal population is required to reverse this trend. The decisions and actions taken by individuals are thought to be influenced by risk perceptions. This study investigates the determinants that shape flood risk perceptions, as well as the factors that drive flood risk misperceptions of coastal residents. We conducted a survey among 871 residents in flood-prone areas in Florida during a five-day period in which the respondents were threatened to be flooded by Hurricane Dorian. This approach allows for assessing temporal dynamics in flood risk perceptions during an evolving hurricane threat. Among 255 of the same households, a follow-up survey was conducted to examine how flood risk perceptions vary after Hurricane Dorian failed to make landfall in Florida. Our results show that the flood experience and social norms have the most consistent relationship with flood risk perceptions. Furthermore, participants indicated that their level of worry regarding the dangers of flooding decreased after the near-miss of Hurricane Dorian, compared to their feelings of worry during the hurricane event. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for improving flood risk communication policies.

In the tax compliance context, the monitoring approach creates compliance based on audits and fines (enforced compliance), in contrast to the trust-based (voluntary compliance) approach, which is based on taxpayers’ willingness to comply. Here, we examine how changes in taxation regarding platform economy revenues affect intended labor supply on such platforms. New EU legislation, effective from 2023, will mandate data sharing between platforms and tax authorities across Europe, thus resulting in increased monitoring. We investigate how this upcoming shift in monitoring power affects the intended use of platforms and how it may interact with users’ trust. We use a survey among platform workers (N = 626) in the Netherlands to examine views of the proposed regulation change, corrected for the proportion of platform income and several measures of trust. We experimentally manipulate information by either informing participants about the upcoming monitoring change or not. Results show that informing respondents about the change negatively affects expected supply of labor, and this effect is independent of respondents’ trust. We discuss the policy implications of these results.

We propose a partial information revelation (\u0026lsquo;recommendation\u0026rsquo;) policy designed to maximize group welfare, and we show its theoretical robustness to well-documented behavioral deviations from the risk neutral, Bayesian, and self-interested benchmark. In a large-scale online experiment with 2600 subjects, we then show that this policy fails to improve upon a full information benchmark even when individual and group objectives are aligned, as the recommended course of action is not followed often enough. In a setting where individual and group interests clash, the recommendation is followed less often, largely by subjects who misunderstand the policy. This provides suggestive evidence in favor of simplicity in information design in multi-agent strategic settings.\n[in review]\n","date":1709683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709683200,"objectID":"10aad57d5ddf5476764c49b63750ddc4","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/project/task-matching/","publishdate":"2024-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/task-matching/","section":"project","summary":"For the 'Greater Good', Please Choose A.

Experimental evidence on the willingness to transmit inconvenient ethical information With Ivan Soraperra and Joël van der Weele.\nAbstract: Information about the consequences of our consumption choices can be unwelcome, and people sometimes avoid it. We investigate a situation where one person possesses information that is inconvenient for another, and study why and when they decide to transmit that information. We introduce a simple and portable experimental game to analyze transmission of inconvenient information. In this game, a Sender can inform a Receiver at a small cost about a negative externality associated with a tempting and profitable action for the Receiver. The results from our online experiment (N = 1,512) show that Senders transmit more information for large negative externalities. Sender\u0026rsquo;s decisions are largely driven by their own preferences for information. However, some Senders take the Receiver\u0026rsquo;s feelings into account, by transmitting evidence of positive externalities or by suppressing negative information upon the Receiver\u0026rsquo;s request. Understanding the decision to share inconvenient information matters, as it will affect the personal and political will to address important externalities and can inform strategies to encourage the transmission of inconvenient information within organizations.\n[R\u0026amp;R]\n","date":1695805200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695805200,"objectID":"9828b8b0810045c3f4555c848c0d4dbf","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/project/the-button/","publishdate":"2023-09-27T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/the-button/","section":"project","summary":"Supply of willful ignorance.

To share responsibly, one needs to be aware of the various consequences sharing has on interacting and third parties. When transparency about such consequences is lacking, mutual trust among interacting parties may encourage people to cooperate and share, in turn creating unintended negative impact. Psychologists have long studied trust and cooperation, yet few insights from psychological science have been used to understand the sharing economy. Here, we propose that evoking trust may paradoxically increase motivated information processing leading people to share irresponsibly by ignoring the negative consequences sharing has on others. We review three conditions under which evoking trust may lead to irresponsible sharing: ethical blind spots, willful ignorance, and misinformation. We propose that transparent information is key to enable and encourage responsible sharing. More psychological research is needed to better understand how this flourishing, trust-based industry can be shaped to encourage safe, cooperative, and responsible sharing.

In this study, we use immersive virtual reality (VR) technology to examine whether a simulated disaster can stimulate people to invest in risk reducing measures in the context of flooding, which is one of the deadliest and most damaging natural disasters in the world. We investigate the possibility to boost risk perception, coping appraisal, negative emotions and damage-reducing behavior through a simulated flooding experience. We find that participants who experienced the virtual flood invest significantly more in the flood risk investment game than those in the control group.

This study draws lessons on how individual hurricane preparedness is influenced by the additional risk stemming from a pandemic, which turns out to be a combination of perceptions of flood and pandemic risks that have opposite effects on preparedness behavior. We conducted a survey in early June 2020 of 600 respondents in flood-prone areas in Florida to obtain insights into households' risk perceptions and preparedness for the upcoming hurricane season under COVID-19. The results show that concerns over COVID-19 dominated flood risk perceptions and negatively impacted people's evacuation intentions. Whereas hotel costs were the main obstacle to evacuating during Hurricane Dorian in 2019 in the same geographic study area, the main evacuation obstacle identified in the 2020 hurricane season is COVID-19. Our statistical analyses investigating the factors influencing evacuation intentions show that older individuals are less likely to evacuate under a voluntary order, because they are more concerned about the consequences of becoming infected by COVID-19. We observe similar findings based on a real-time survey we conducted in Florida with another group of respondents under the threat of Hurricane Eta at the end of the hurricane season in November 2020. We discuss the implications of our findings for risk communication and emergency management policies that aim to improve hurricane preparedness when dealing with additional health risks such as a pandemic, a situation that may be exacerbated under the future climate.","tags":["COVID-19","evacuation","hurricane preparedness","pandemic","risk perception"],"title":"Individual hurricane evacuation intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic: insights for risk communication and emergency management policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637078400,"objectID":"50576cbc722f3b75848bdeed431601fd","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/talk/kvs-cafe-2021/","publishdate":"2021-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/kvs-cafe-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation at the KvS Economencafé (in Dutch).","tags":[],"title":"KVS (Dutch)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632794400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632794400,"objectID":"0f089d918ec6cd03ceb1a37948755649","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/talk/focus2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/focus2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Radio Interview in science program on Radio 1 (in Dutch)","tags":[],"title":"Radio Focus","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Jantsje M Mol**"],"categories":null,"content":"You can find the PDF of the full thesis here and you can watch the 10 minute (English) summary here:\nA one hour interview (in Dutch) about the thesis can be found here:\n","date":1631232000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631232000,"objectID":"f72946e77391678ed75c7f8fd87ecd83","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/publication/mol-2021-thesis/","publishdate":"2021-09-10T08:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mol-2021-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Flooding is one of the most dangerous natural hazards worldwide, causing widespread economic damage in coastal areas, thousands of deaths and injuries, and displacing millions of people every year. Individual homeowners can take a number of measures to reduce potential flood damage to their homes, but few people in flood-prone areas invest in these measures. This thesis examines several factors that could explain the lack of voluntary investment, including moral hazard, risk misperceptions and bounded rationality. Furthermore, this thesis investigates various incentives to stimulate investments in damage-reducing measures, such as insurance incentives, risk communication in virtual reality and social norm-nudges. This is achieved by experimental economics methods: lab experiments with students, online experiments in surveys with homeowners in flood-prone areas, as well as an economic experiment using a virtual reality experience.

However, the SSHWS considers only the wind hazard of a TC, whereas a TC can also cause severe conditions through its high storm surges and extreme rainfall, triggering coastal and inland flooding. Consequently, the SSHWS fails to mirror the TC’s total severity. This becomes evident when looking at past events such as Hurricane Harvey (2017), which was classified as a Tropical Storm while it caused widespread flooding in the Houston (TX) area, with precipitation totals exceeding 1.5 m. Without including storm surge and rainfall information, adequate risk communication with the SSHWS can be challenging, as the public can (mistakenly) perceive a low-category TC as a low-risk TC. To overcome this, we propose the new Tropical Cyclone Severity Scale (TCSS) that includes all three major TC hazards in its classification. The new scale preserves the categorization as used in the SSHWS, to maintain familiarity amongst the general public. In addition, we extend the scale with a Category 6, to support communication about the most extreme TCs with multiple hazards. The TCSS is designed to be applied on a local-scale, hereby supporting local-scale risk communication efforts and evacuation strategies prior to a TC landfall. The scale can be used for risk communication on both the total TC risk and on the categories of the separate hazards, which can be valuable especially in cases when one hazard is the predominant risk factor, such as excess rainfall triggering flooding.

We experimentally varied the insurance type (mandatory public versus voluntary private) and the availability of a premium discount incentive for investing in flood damage mitigation measures. This set-up allowed us to examine the existence of moral hazard, advantageous selection and the behavioral motivations of individual agents who face these different insurance types, without the selection bias that makes a causal inference from survey studies problematic. The main results show that a premium discount can increase investments in self-insurance under both private and public insurance. Moreover, we find no support for moral hazard in our natural disaster insurance market, but we do find a substantial share of cautious people who invest both in private insurance as well as in self-insurance, indicating advantageous selection. The results have implications for the design of insurance schemes to cope with increasing natural disaster risks.

De laatste tijd is er een toenemende belangenstelling bij beleid in hoe gedragsinzichten kunnen bijdragen aan effectieve beleidsmaatregelen ten aanzien van klimaatadaptatie. Het gaat dan om onderwerpen als drinkwaterbesparing, zeespiegelstijging en klimaatadaptieve maatregelen genomen door specifieke doelgroepen zoals het MKB. Door het schetsen van het theoretische kader en hoe een labexperiment is ingericht, krijgt beleid meer feeling met het inschatten wat het effect is van het betrekken van gedragsinzichten bij de beleidsvorming.

Nevertheless, voluntary take-up of individual damage reduction measures is low. A potential explanation is that flood risk perceptions of individual homeowners are below objective estimates of flood risk, which may imply that they underestimate the flood risk and the damage that can be avoided by damage reduction measures. The aim of this paper is to assess possible flood risk misperceptions of floodplain residents in the Netherlands, and to offer insights into factors that are related with under- or overestimation of perceived flood risk. We analyzed survey data of 1848 homeowners in the Dutch river delta and examine how perceptions of flood probability and damage relate to objective risk assessments, such as safety standards of dikes, as well as heuristics, including the availability heuristic and the affect heuristic. Results show that many Dutch floodplain inhabitants significantly overestimate the probability, but underestimate the maximum expected water level of a flood. We further observe that many respondents apply the availability heuristic.

We use a lab experiment (N = 357) to investigate the effects of different financial incentives, probability levels and deductibles on damage reducing investments in a natural disaster insurance market with compulsory coverage. In particular, we examine how these investments are jointly influenced by financial incentives, like a disincentive from moral hazard or positive incentives from premium discounts or a mitigation loan, and behavioral characteristics, like individual risk and time preferences. We find that investments increase when the expected value of damage increases (i.e. higher deductibles, higher probabilities). Moral hazard is found in the high probability scenarios (15%), but not in the low probability scenarios (3%). This observation suggests that moral hazard is less of an issue in a natural disaster insurance market where probabilities are low. Our results demonstrate that a premium discount can increase investments in damage reduction, as can the behavioral characteristics of risk aversion, perceived efficacy of protective measures and worry about flooding.\n","tags":["Behavioral insurance","Moral hazard","Lab experiment","Natural disasters","Damage-reduction measures"],"title":"Risk reduction in compulsory disaster insurance: Experimental evidence on moral hazard and financial incentives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jantsje M Mol**","Eline C M van der Heijden","Jan J M Potters"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578960000,"objectID":"2dc430ca3f93779d9a09dcdff452b79b","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/publication/mol-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T09:11:10.439228Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mol-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted an experiment in a high-immersive virtual reality environment to study the effect of the presence of a virtual observer on cheating behavior.
